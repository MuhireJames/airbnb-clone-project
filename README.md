This  is a project that provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments.Some of goals are:user management,property management,booking management payments integrations,user reviews and data optimimisation.  
Stack to be used :Django,Django rest framework,GraphQl,PostgreSQL,Docker,Redis and CI/CD pipelines and Celery as payment gateway  

Team Roles  
Business Analyst:Who will be responsible for understanding customerâ€™s business processes and translate customer business needs into requirements
